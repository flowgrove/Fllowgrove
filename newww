# Flowgrove Keep-Alive Script

This repository contains a Python script to keep a web application alive on platforms like Render. The script pings your deployed URL periodically to prevent the app from going idle.

## Features
- Automatic periodic HTTP requests
- Self-healing: restarts if it crashes
- Logging of success, warning, and error messages
- Fully daemonized: runs in background without blocking main program

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/flowgrove/Flowgrove.git
pip install requests
python keep_alive.py
	•	Change the URL variable in keep_alive.py to your deployed application’s URL.
	•	Adjust PING_INTERVAL to change the ping frequency (default is 600 seconds, i.e., 10 minutes).

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/flowgrove/Flowgrove.git
cd rn
pip install -r requirements.txt
python kn_ai.py

If you want, I can **rewrite all the files with the `rn` folder in mind**, so it’s **copy-paste ready**, fully autonomous, and self-contained.  

Do you want me to do that next?
